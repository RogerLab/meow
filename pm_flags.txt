PM is an extension of MAMMaL, and some input flags are different. 
Here is a list of all flags accepted by PM and whether or not they are required:

-s seqfile (required) : name of input sequence file 

-p partition_type (optional) : method to use to partition the sequence data (Default: "E")
	accepted values:
	"E" : partition by entropy
	"R" : partition by rates (method used in MAMMaL)
	"K" : partition by K-eff value

-t treefile (optional) : name of input tree file 
	if not set and partition type is "R", a neighbour joining tree will be generated using the LG algorithm

-c nclasses (optional) : number of frequency classes to use in both the high and low sequence partitions

-ch nhigh (required if -c not set) : number of frequency classes to use in the high sequence partition

-cl nlow (required if -c not set) : number of frequency classes to use in the low sequence partition

-o outfile (optional) : name of output file (Default: esmodel.nex)

-q quantile (optional) : quantile to use for partitioning data (Default: 0.75)

-C penalty (optional) : the penalty parameter to use (Default: 1.0e-10)

-f cluster_type (optional) : clustering algorithm to use (Default: "H"*)
	accepted values:
	"C" : c-series
	"H" : hierarchical clustering 

-log log_type (optional) : method to use for outputting program  logs (Default: "B")
	accepted values:
	"N" : Do not output any logs
	"F" : Output logs to "pm_output.log"
	"X" : Include program logs in the .nex file
	"B" : Put logs in both "pm_output.log" and the output .nex file

-lm min_weight (optional) : sets the minimum likelihood weight (Default: 1.0e-10)

-I (optional) : remove invariant sites from sequence data before processing it

-m (optional) : don't output the .nex file

-d (optional) : use +F

-l (optional) : don't use likelihood weighting 

-pf (optional) : don't delete the low and high sequence files

-ff (optional) : don't delete the estimated-frequencies files

-suf (optional) : use a random suffix for output files, allowing running multiple instances at once


* "C" if both -ch and -cl are a multiple of 10 (including 0)
