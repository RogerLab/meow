#### v0.5.3 2022-10-11
- Made program check for incompatible sequence files (taxa names with less than or fewer than 10 characters)
	- Will generate a new sequence file if the provided one is incompatible, instead of crashing
	- If using rates, does the same with the treefile

#### v0.5.2 2022-09-22
- Changed output file name to match desired ouput when given zero high partition classes or zero low partition classes
  (formerly would add ".high.nex" or ".low.nex" to the end of the files)
- Added -tmp flag which prevents the program from deleting any of the temporary files generated by it
- Added -cf flag which allows specifying cluster centres without using the H-clust method 
- The program now generates two "tmp.err" files, one for each partition. (1 = high, 2 = low)
- Allow specifying a custom suffix with the -suf flag

#### v0.5.1 2022-09-04
- Added option to include invariant class in output nexus file
- Changed remove invariant flag from -I to -ri
- Added flags:
	- Invariant class (-I)
	- Sort sequence file (-sort)
	- Add epsilon to H-Clust (-e)
- Added "total classes" count to output log
- Various bug fixes
- Updated tests to reflect changes

#### v0.5.0 2022-07-08
